Build a Game with Javascript
Overview
Use Javascript to complete key functions to run a hot and cold app.
Follow the instructions for challenges on the ReadMe and in the app.js file.
All the code you'll write will be on the app.js file.
Building your game
Step 1: Creating a random number. The first thing we need for our application to work is a target number. Write a function that returns a random number. For this you'll need to declare a function, then return the value using a randomization equation. For help with that, you can check out this Javascript documentation on the function Math.random.

Step 2: Assigning your random number to a variable. Once you've got your random number function working, we need to put it somewhere. Declare a variable and set the value of that variable as the random number you generate with the function you just wrote.

Step 3: Checking the user's guess. Finally, we need a function that checks whether or not the user's guess matches the randomly generated number. Fill in the rest of this declared function with an if/else statement that gives feedback to the user on whether or not they got the right number.

Working version: Here's a link to a working version of the app.
